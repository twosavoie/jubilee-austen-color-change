                <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                <p>I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my small growing family. My journey into
                    tech
                    started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with
                    how
                    easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to
                    fit
                    my own specific needs.</p>
                <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first
                    website,
                    I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work.
                    Now
                    I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for
                    detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

                    <p>My focus is writing clean, well formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content
                        is
                        easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                        and
                        fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best-practices.</p>
